# Follow on Mastodon

A browser extension to make it easier to follow any Mastodon user from your preferred instance.

## Installation

You can install it from the Firefox Add-ons page: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/follow-on-mastodon/>

## Setup

To get to the settings page for _Follow on Mastodon,_ navigate to:

1. Main Firefox menu
2. "Add-ons and themes"
3. "..." button beside "Follow on Mastodon"
4. "Preferences" in the menu that pops up

On that page, enter the domain for your Mastodon instance, and click "Save."

That's it! You can now easily follow Mastodon accounts.

(There's no visual confirmation, but it should be stored at that point.)

## Usage

Go to a Mastodon profile &mdash; mine is https://weirder.earth/@puppy &mdash; and then click the "Follow on Mastodon" button.

It should take you to a page where you can follow the specified account. :)

## Icons
